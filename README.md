# Formative Assessment 2

This is a non-guided assessment for which you need to pick a data set and run a BRM with one continuous outcome variable and one categorical predictor variable.

You will have to:

- Find a suitable data set.
- Fit a `brm()` model with a continuous outcome variable and a categorical predictor (the categorical predictor can have 2 or more levels).
- Interpret and plot the model output.

**IMPORTANT**: Please, save your data in the `data/` folder and write your code in the `code/analysis.Rmd` file. Remember to render the  `analysis.Rmd` file to HTML.
